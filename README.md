# Bike Sharing Dataset Analysis

This repository contains code for analyzing the Bike Sharing dataset using Python and popular data analysis libraries. The dataset includes hourly and daily counts of rental bikes, along with various features like temperature, weather conditions, and more.

> This project is the final project from Dicoding for the course "Learning Data Analysis With Python". Check the dashboard [Here](https://dashboardpy-xitmaxhdtrq76awwwg7a9h.streamlit.app/)

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- NumPy: `pip install numpy`
- Pandas: `pip install pandas`
- Matplotlib: `pip install matplotlib`
- Seaborn: `pip install seaborn`

## Dataset

The dataset is available in the `data` directory. Two CSV files, `day.csv` and `hour.csv`, are used for daily and hourly analyses, respectively.

## Running the Analysis

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
2. Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script to perform the analysis.
